### ⚙️ Installation and Local Setup

To set up the project on your local machine for development and testing, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Sahil980427/sahil-portfolio.git](https://github.com/Sahil980427/sahil-portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd sahil-portfolio
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use Yarn:
    # yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or if you use Yarn:
    # yarn dev
    ```
    Your application should now be accessible locally, usually at `http://localhost:5173` (check your terminal for the exact address).

### 🚢 Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment to GitHub Pages using Vite.

1.  **Verify `homepage` in `package.json`:**
    Ensure the `homepage` field in your `package.json` correctly points to your GitHub Pages URL:
    ```json
    "homepage": "[https://Sahil980427.github.io/sahil-portfolio/](https://Sahil980427.github.io/sahil-portfolio/)",
    ```
2.  **Verify `base` in `vite.config.js`:**
    Confirm that your `vite.config.js` has the `base` property set to your repository name:
    ```javascript
    base: "/sahil-portfolio",
    ```
3.  **Verify `basename` in `App.js`:**
    Ensure your `BrowserRouter` component in `App.js` uses the correct `basename` prop:
    ```jsx
    <Router basename="/sahil-portfolio">
    ```
4.  **Build the project:**
    Generate the production-ready build of your application:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    # yarn build
    ```
    The optimized build files will be generated in the `dist` folder.
5.  **Publish to GitHub Pages:**
    * **Manual Setup:** Go to your GitHub repository settings, navigate to "Pages," and select the branch (`main` or `gh-pages`) from which you want to deploy, ensuring you specify the `/dist` folder as the source.
    * **(Optional) Using `gh-pages` package:** If you have the `gh-pages` package installed and configured in your `package.json` scripts (`"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"`), you can simply run:
        ```bash
        npm run deploy
        # or
        # yarn deploy
        ```
        This command will automatically push the contents of your `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch, triggering a GitHub Pages deployment.

### 💡 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for evolving this portfolio:

* **Dynamic Content Integration:** Add a blog or news section, possibly by integrating a Headless CMS (e.g., Strapi, Contentful) to manage content more easily.
* **Advanced 3D Interactivity:** Explore more complex Three.js scenes, including physics simulations, real-time lighting, or custom shaders.
* **Backend Integration:** Implement a small backend for handling contact form submissions more robustly or for dynamic content loading.
* **Testing Suite:** Introduce unit tests (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) and end-to-end tests (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
* **Performance Optimization:** Further optimize loading times and responsiveness, perhaps using lazy loading for components or image optimization techniques.
